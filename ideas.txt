Issues
======

- passive/active issue fields, similar to the hotlist
- "template" for issues: suggested fields and their order (per project?)
- how do we do workflow for issues? someone has to be the "one with the ball"
    - active fields specific for workflow status?
- user fields could be overlapping bubbles by default or something
- tags
- audit of changes as auto created comments?
